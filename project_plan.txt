## 3. Core Components

Each core component will be a distinct microservice (or a logical module within a service) with its own responsibilities.

### 3.1. Authentication & User Service

#### 1. Core Functionality
-   User registration, login, and logout.
-   User profile management (update details, change password).
-   Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for different user types (e.g., admin, standard user).
-   JWT (JSON Web Token) generation and validation for secure API access.

#### 2. Technical Design & Architecture
-   **Technology**: Python FastAPI.
-   **Database**: PostgreSQL for user credentials (hashed passwords), roles, and profile information.
-   **Authentication**: OAuth2.0 password flow for token generation, JWT for stateless authentication. PyJWT library.
-   **API Endpoints**:
    -   `POST /auth/register`: User registration.
    -   `POST /auth/token`: Obtain JWT token.
    -   `GET /users/me`: Get current user profile.
    -   `PUT /users/me`: Update current user profile.
    -   `DELETE /users/me`: Delete user account (soft delete).
-   **Data Structures**: User model (ID, username, email, hashed_password, role, created_at, updated_at).

#### 3. User Experience
-   Standard login/registration forms.
-   Clear feedback on authentication status (success/failure).
-   User profile page for managing personal information.

#### 4. Data Management
-   **Database Schema**: `users` table: `id (PK)`, `username (unique)`, `email (unique)`, `password_hash`, `role`, `created_at`, `updated_at`.
-   **Password Hashing**: `bcrypt` (or `argon2`) using `passlib` library.
-   **Data Migration**: Alembic for database schema management.

#### 5. Error Handling & Edge Cases
-   Invalid credentials: Return 401 Unauthorized.
-   Duplicate username/email during registration: Return 409 Conflict.
-   Malformed requests: Return 400 Bad Request.
-   Password complexity requirements enforced at registration.

#### 6. Security Considerations
-   **Password Hashing**: Store only salted and hashed passwords.
-   **JWT Security**: Use strong secret keys, short expiry times, store tokens securely on client-side (HttpOnly cookies or memory for SPAs).
-   **Input Validation**: Sanitize all user inputs to prevent injection attacks.
-   **Rate Limiting**: Implement for login attempts to prevent brute-force attacks.
-   **HTTPS**: All communication must be over HTTPS.

#### 7. Performance & Scalability
-   **Stateless JWT**: Reduces server load as session data is not stored server-side.
-   **Database Indexing**: Indexes on `username` and `email` for fast lookups.
-   **Scalability**: Service can be horizontally scaled independently.

#### 8. Deployment & Infrastructure
-   Containerized using Docker.
-   Deployed on AWS ECS/EKS.
-   PostgreSQL managed by AWS RDS.

#### 9. Test-Driven Development Verification
-   **Immediate Verification**:
    -   Manually test `POST /auth/register` and `POST /auth/token` via curl or Postman to ensure basic success/failure responses.
    -   Run a simple FastAPI `uvicorn` instance locally and hit endpoints.
-   **Incremental Testing**:
    -   Start with unit tests for password hashing utility function.
    -   Test user creation logic in isolation (without DB).
    -   Test JWT encoding/decoding function.

#### 10. Testing Strategy

##### 10.1 Testing Hierarchy
1.  **Unit Tests - Simple Cases First**
    -   Test `hash_password(password)` and `verify_password(plain, hashed)` functions.
    -   Test `create_access_token(data)` for correct JWT generation.
    -   Test `authenticate_user(username, password)` function with valid/invalid credentials (mocking DB calls for simplicity, or using an in-memory DB).
    -   Test `get_current_user` dependency logic.
2.  **Integration Tests - Minimal Setup**
    -   Use `TestClient` from `fastapi.testclient` to test API endpoints.
    -   Test `POST /auth/register` against a test PostgreSQL database (e.g., using `testcontainers` or a local Dockerized DB).
    -   Test `POST /auth/token` to ensure token issuance and subsequent `GET /users/me` with the token.
    -   Verify roles and permissions using a test user.
3.  **End-to-End Tests - Critical Paths Only**
    -   Use Playwright/Cypress to simulate a full user registration, login, and profile update flow through the frontend, interacting with the deployed backend.

##### 10.2 Mocking Strategy - SIMPLIFIED APPROACH
-   **Prefer Dependency Injection**: All external dependencies (e.g., database session, password hasher) will be injected into functions/classes.
-   **Use Simple Stubs**: For unit tests, `mock.patch` or simple Python objects can stub out database repository methods (e.g., `UserRepository.get_by_username`).
-   **Mock at System Boundaries**: Mock `requests` if making external HTTP calls (though not expected for this service's core). For database interactions in unit tests, use in-memory alternatives or simple mocks; for integration tests, use a real, isolated test database.

##### 10.3 Testing Tools & Frameworks
-   **Python**: `pytest`, `pytest-asyncio`, `pytest-cov` (coverage).
-   **Mocking**: Built-in `unittest.mock`.
-   **Test Database**: PostgreSQL for integration tests (via `testcontainers` or local setup).
-   **Common Test Patterns**:
    -   `test_api_endpoint_success_status_code()`
    -   `test_api_endpoint_invalid_input()`
    -   `test_service_method_with_mocked_dependency()`

##### 10.4 Test Data Management
-   **Creation**: Use `factory-boy` or simple Python functions to generate test user data. For integration tests, a dedicated `conftest.py` fixture will set up and tear down a clean database state per test.
-   **Cleanup**: `pytest` fixtures with `yield` will ensure database cleanup after each test/suite (e.g., truncate tables, drop schema).

#### 11. Monitoring & Logging
-   **Logging**: Python `logging` module configured to output JSON logs. Logs aggregated by CloudWatch Logs (AWS).
-   **Monitoring**: FastAPI endpoints will be instrumented with Prometheus client library (`prometheus_client`) to expose metrics (request counts, latency). Grafana dashboards for visualization.
-   **Alerting**: CloudWatch Alarms for error rates, high latency, or service unavailability.

#### 12. Dependencies
-   PostgreSQL Database.
-   `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `python-jose[cryptography]`, `passlib[bcrypt]`, `SQLAlchemy`, `psycopg2-binary`.

#### 13. Potential Risks & Mitigations
-   **Risk**: Brute-force attacks on login.
    -   **Mitigation**: Implement rate limiting on login endpoint (e.g., using `fastapi-limiter`).
-   **Risk**: JWT secret key compromise.
    -   **Mitigation**: Store secret key securely (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager). Rotate keys regularly.
-   **Risk**: SQL Injection.
    -   **Mitigation**: Use SQLAlchemy ORM which handles parameterization automatically. Input validation.

---

### 3.2. Data Ingestion Service

#### 1. Core Functionality
-   Receive raw energy data (e.g., consumption, production, environmental factors) from various sources (REST API calls from IoT devices/gateways, third-party energy provider APIs).
-   Validate incoming data format and content.
-   Publish validated data to a Kafka topic for further processing.

#### 2. Technical Design & Architecture
-   **Technology**: Python FastAPI.
-   **Messaging**: Apache Kafka Producer (using `confluent-kafka-python` or `kafka-python`).
-   **API Endpoints**:
    -   `POST /ingest/energy_data`: Receive energy meter readings.
    -   `POST /ingest/weather_data`: Receive weather station data.
-   **Data Structures**: Define Pydantic models for incoming data payload (e.g., `EnergyData(device_id: str, timestamp: datetime, consumption_kwh: float, production_kwh: float)`).
-   **Schema Registry**: Potentially use Confluent Schema Registry for Avro/Protobuf schemas on Kafka messages, though JSON will be simpler initially.

#### 3. User Experience
-   This is a backend service; no direct user interaction.

#### 4. Data Management
-   Data is immediately pushed to Kafka. No direct database storage for raw incoming data in this service.
-   **Kafka Topics**:
    -   `raw_energy_data`: For energy meter readings.
    -   `raw_weather_data`: For weather data.
-   **Message Format**: JSON (initially, for simplicity and flexibility).

#### 5. Error Handling & Edge Cases
-   **Invalid Data**: Return 400 Bad Request with detailed error messages if Pydantic validation fails.
-   **Kafka Producer Failure**: Implement retry logic for Kafka message publishing. If persistent failure, log and alert. Potentially route to a Dead-Letter Queue (DLQ) Kafka topic.
-   **Rate Limiting**: Implement for API endpoints to prevent abuse.

#### 6. Security Considerations
-   **Authentication/Authorization**: API key authentication for IoT devices/gateways, or JWT validation if the source is a known application.
-   **Input Validation**: Strict Pydantic validation.
-   **HTTPS**: Mandatory for all API communication.

#### 7. Performance & Scalability
-   **Asynchronous I/O**: FastAPI's `async/await` ensures non-blocking operations.
-   **Kafka**: High-throughput message queue scales well horizontally.
-   **Scalability**: Service can be horizontally scaled to handle high ingestion rates.

#### 8. Deployment & Infrastructure
-   Containerized using Docker.
-   Deployed on AWS ECS/EKS.
-   Leverages AWS MSK (Managed Streaming for Kafka) as the message queue.

#### 9. Test-Driven Development Verification
-   **Immediate Verification**:
    -   Manually send a `POST` request to `/ingest/energy_data` endpoint using `curl` or Postman with valid/invalid JSON payloads.
    -   Observe service logs to confirm data validation success/failure and Kafka production attempts.
-   **Incremental Testing**:
    -   Test Pydantic models for data validation logic in isolation.
    -   Test Kafka producer helper function to ensure it can send messages (mocking Kafka connection for unit tests).

#### 10. Testing Strategy

##### 10.1 Testing Hierarchy
1.  **Unit Tests - Simple Cases First**
    -   Test Pydantic data models for valid and invalid inputs (`EnergyData.parse_obj`).
    -   Test the `send_to_kafka` utility function, mocking the Kafka producer client.
2.  **Integration Tests - Minimal Setup**
    -   Use `TestClient` to send mock HTTP requests to the FastAPI endpoints.
    -   For Kafka interaction, use `testcontainers` with a local Kafka instance, or a lightweight in-memory Kafka substitute if available for Python (less common, so prefer `testcontainers`).
    -   Verify that messages are correctly published to the specified Kafka topics and their content is as expected.
3.  **End-to-End Tests - Critical Paths Only**
    -   Simulate an IoT device sending data to the `Data Ingestion Service`.
    -   Verify that the `Real-time Processing Service` (the next consumer) successfully receives and processes this data. This requires orchestrating multiple services in a test environment.

##### 10.2 Mocking Strategy - SIMPLIFIED APPROACH
-   **Prefer Dependency Injection**: Kafka producer client will be injected into the API route handlers.
-   **Use Simple Stubs**: For unit tests, the Kafka producer can be mocked using `unittest.mock` to verify `send()` calls.
-   **Mock at System Boundaries**: Mock the Kafka client when unit testing the API logic itself. For integration tests, use a real Kafka instance (e.g., via `testcontainers`).

##### 10.3 Testing Tools & Frameworks
-   **Python**: `pytest`, `pytest-asyncio`.
-   **Mocking**: Built-in `unittest.mock`.
-   **Test Kafka**: `testcontainers-python` for spinning up a Kafka container.

##### 10.4 Test Data Management
-   **Creation**: Define valid and invalid JSON payloads for incoming data directly in test files.
-   **Cleanup**: Kafka topics used for testing can be configured with short retention periods, or test-specific topics can be created and deleted if supported by `testcontainers`.

#### 11. Monitoring & Logging
-   **Logging**: JSON logs of incoming requests, validation results, and Kafka publish status. CloudWatch Logs for aggregation.
-   **Monitoring**: Prometheus metrics for request count, latency, success/failure rate of Kafka messages. Grafana dashboards.
-   **Alerting**: CloudWatch Alarms on high error rates, low message production rates, or Kafka connectivity issues.

#### 12. Dependencies
-   Apache Kafka (AWS MSK).
-   `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `pydantic`, `confluent-kafka` (or `kafka-python`).

#### 13. Potential Risks & Mitigations
-   **Risk**: Data format changes from external sources.
    -   **Mitigation**: Robust schema validation (Pydantic). Implement versioning for API endpoints (`/v1/ingest/energy_data`). Maintain clear documentation for data providers.
-   **Risk**: Kafka backlog due to high ingestion.
    -   **Mitigation**: Monitor Kafka consumer lag. Auto-scaling of the Data Ingestion Service. Provision Kafka topic partitions appropriately.
-   **Risk**: Data loss if Kafka is unavailable.
    -   **Mitigation**: Implement retry mechanisms and potential DLQ for failed Kafka pushes.

### 3.3. Real-time Processing Service

#### 1. Core Functionality
-   Consume raw energy data from Kafka topics.
-   Perform data cleansing, normalization, and aggregation (e.g., sum kWh per minute/hour).
-   Identify anomalies (e.g., sudden spikes, zeros) using simple statistical methods.
-   Enrich data with metadata (e.g., device location, type).
-   Store processed, enriched, and aggregated data into the time-series database.

#### 2. Technical Design & Architecture
-   **Technology**: Python (custom consumer using `confluent-kafka-python` or `kafka-python`). Could evolve to Apache Flink/Spark Streaming if complexity increases significantly, but start simpler.
-   **Messaging**: Apache Kafka Consumer.
-   **Database**: InfluxDB for time-series data storage.
-   **Processing Logic**: Python scripts running continuously, polling Kafka. Use a producer-consumer pattern within the service for concurrent processing and database writes.
-   **Data Structures**: Pydantic models for processed data (e.g., `ProcessedEnergyData(device_id: str, timestamp: datetime, aggregated_kwh: float, anomaly_flag: bool)`).

#### 3. User Experience
-   No direct user interaction.

#### 4. Data Management
-   **Input**: `raw_energy_data` Kafka topic.
-   **Output**: InfluxDB.
    -   **Measurements**: `energy_consumption`, `energy_production`, `device_status`, `anomalies`.
    -   **Tags**: `device_id`, `location`, `energy_source_type`.
    -   **Fields**: `value_kwh`, `is_anomaly`, `aggregated_period_minutes`.
-   **Data Retention**: Configure InfluxDB retention policies (e.g., raw data for 30 days, aggregated data for 5 years).

#### 5. Error Handling & Edge Cases
-   **Malformed Messages**: Messages failing schema validation or processing errors are logged and moved to a Kafka DLQ for manual inspection.
-   **Database Write Failures**: Retry mechanism for InfluxDB writes. If persistent, alert and log.
-   **Backpressure**: Monitor consumer lag; auto-scale consumer instances if processing falls behind.
-   **Out-of-Order Data**: InfluxDB handles out-of-order data, but processing logic should account for potential timestamp discrepancies.

#### 6. Security Considerations
-   **Kafka Access**: Authenticate with Kafka using SASL/SSL.
-   **InfluxDB Access**: Use least-privilege credentials.
-   **Data Validation**: Re-validate data even if ingested by previous service, for robustness.

#### 7. Performance & Scalability
-   **Kafka Partitions**: Multiple consumer instances can process data from different Kafka partitions concurrently.
-   **Batch Writes**: Optimize InfluxDB writes by batching data points.
-   **Scalability**: Horizontally scalable by deploying more instances of the service.
-   **Efficiency**: Optimize Python processing loops for CPU and memory usage.

#### 8. Deployment & Infrastructure
-   Containerized using Docker.
-   Deployed on AWS ECS/EKS.
-   InfluxDB can be self-hosted on EC2 or managed service (if available, or a comparable time-series DB like AWS Timestream).

#### 9. Test-Driven Development Verification
-   **Immediate Verification**:
    -   Manually publish messages to the `raw_energy_data` Kafka topic (e.g., using `kafka-console-producer`).
    -   Observe the Real-time Processing Service logs to confirm messages are consumed and processed.
    -   Query InfluxDB manually to verify processed data is stored correctly.

### 4.3 CI/CD Pipeline Considerations
-   **Source Control**: GitHub.
-   **Build**:
    -   Frontend: `npm install`, `npm run build`.
    -   Backend Services: Python dependency installation, Docker image build.
-   **Testing**: Run unit, integration, and potentially E2E tests.
-   **Deployment**:
    -   Frontend: Build artifacts deployed to S3 and invalidated CloudFront cache.
    -   Backend Services: Docker images pushed to AWS ECR (Elastic Container Registry), then ECS service definitions updated for rolling deployments.
-   **Workflow**:
    1.  `git push` to `main` branch triggers CI.
    2.  Tests run, linting, security scans.
    3.  On success, Docker images built and pushed to ECR.
    4.  Terraform applies updates to ECS service definitions.
    5.  Frontend static assets deployed to S3.

## 5. Testing and Quality Assurance

### 5.1 Testing Hierarchy (Applied across all components)
1.  **Unit Tests - Simple Cases First**: Focus on individual functions, methods, and components in isolation. Test pure functions, business logic without external dependencies.
    -   **Immediate Verification**: Assert direct function outputs, component renders with mock props.
    -   **Incremental Testing**: Build up from smallest testable units.
2.  **Integration Tests - Minimal Setup**: Verify interaction between components or services.
    -   Test API endpoints, database interactions, message queue communication.
    -   Use lightweight, in-memory alternatives (e.g., SQLite for PostgreSQL, `moto` for S3, `testcontainers` for external services like Kafka/InfluxDB) when possible to keep tests fast and isolated.
3.  **End-to-End Tests - Critical Paths Only**: Simulate user journeys through the entire system.
    -   Focus on the most important user flows (e.g., register, login, view dashboard, check reports).
    -   These tests are slower and more brittle; keep them sparse and high-value.

### 5.2 Mocking Strategy - SIMPLIFIED APPROACH
-   **Design for Testability**: Favor dependency injection, single responsibility principle, and separation of concerns (business logic from infrastructure). This minimizes the need for complex mocks.
-   **Prefer Real Implementations**: Use real objects/modules unless external dependencies (databases, APIs, message queues) are unavoidable.
-   **Use Test Doubles Hierarchy**:
    1.  **Real Implementations**: Use actual instances when possible and practical (e.g., an in-memory database for integration tests).
    2.  **Fake Implementations**: Simple, in-memory versions of complex dependencies (e.g., an in-memory Kafka queue if a Python library provides one for testing).
    3.  **Stubs**: Simple, hardcoded responses for specific method calls (e.g., a function returning a fixed value instead of making an API call).
    4.  **Mocks**: Objects that record interactions and verify behavior. Used sparingly, typically at system boundaries to verify calls to external systems. Python's `unittest.mock` will be the primary tool.
-   **Mock at System Boundaries**: When testing a service, mock its interactions with other services (e.g., API calls, database queries, message queue publishes/consumes). Avoid mocking internal components within a single service.

### 5.3 Testing Tools & Frameworks
-   **Backend (Python)**:
    -   `pytest`: Primary testing framework.
    -   `pytest-asyncio`: For testing FastAPI asynchronous code.
    -   `pytest-cov`: For test coverage reporting.
    -   `unittest.mock`: Python's built-in mocking library.
    -   `fastapi.testclient.TestClient`: For integration testing FastAPI endpoints.
    -   `testcontainers-python`: For spinning up Docker containers of databases (PostgreSQL, InfluxDB) and message queues (Kafka, Redis) for integration tests.
    -   `moto`: For mocking AWS services (S3, SQS, etc.) in integration tests.
-   **Frontend (React/Next.js)**:
    -   `Jest`: Testing framework.
    -   `React Testing Library`: For testing React components with user-centric focus.
    -   `msw` (Mock Service Worker): For mocking API requests in integration tests.
    -   `Playwright` or `Cypress`: For End-to-End browser automation tests.

### 5.4 Test Data Management
-   **Generation**:
    -   **Unit Tests**: Simple, in-memory Python dictionaries/Pydantic models for request bodies or function inputs.
    -   **Integration Tests**: `factory-boy` or custom Python scripts to generate realistic but controlled data for database and message queue seeding via `testcontainers`. For InfluxDB, specific time-series patterns.
    -   **E2E Tests**: A dedicated API endpoint or script to populate the test environment with a known baseline dataset.
-   **Cleanup**:
    -   `pytest` fixtures with `yield` statements will ensure test data (e.g., in databases/message queues provisioned by `testcontainers`) is cleaned up after each test or test suite, ensuring isolation.
    -   Kafka test topics will have short retention policies or be explicitly deleted.

## 6. Monitoring & Logging

### 6.1 Logging
-   **Format**: All services will output structured logs (JSON format) containing essential information such as timestamp, service name, log level, request ID, message, and relevant context (e.g., user ID, device ID).
-   **Centralized Logging**: AWS CloudWatch Logs will collect logs from all services.
-   **Log Analysis**: CloudWatch Logs Insights or an ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) stack for querying and analyzing logs.
-   **Log Levels**: Standard levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL) will be used appropriately.

### 6.2 Monitoring
-   **Metrics Collection**:
    -   **Application Metrics**: Prometheus client libraries will be integrated into backend services to expose custom metrics (e.g., API request latency, request count, error rates, Kafka consumer lag, model inference time).
    -   **Infrastructure Metrics**: AWS CloudWatch metrics for EC2, ECS, RDS, MSK, S3, etc.
    -   **Database Metrics**: Built-in metrics from RDS (PostgreSQL) and InfluxDB for performance.
-   **Visualization**: Grafana dashboards will be used to visualize Prometheus and CloudWatch metrics. Custom dashboards for key business metrics (e.g., total energy consumed, number of active devices).
-   **Tracing**: AWS X-Ray (or OpenTelemetry with Jaeger) for distributed tracing to visualize request flows across microservices and identify bottlenecks.

### 6.3 Alerting
-   **Threshold-based Alerts**: AWS CloudWatch Alarms will be configured for critical metrics (e.g., high error rates, service unavailability, low disk space, high CPU/memory utilization, Kafka consumer lag).
-   **Error Tracking**: Sentry.io will be integrated into frontend and backend services to capture and report application errors in real-time, providing stack traces and context.
-   **Notification Channels**: Alerts will be routed to Slack, PagerDuty, or email for immediate team awareness.
